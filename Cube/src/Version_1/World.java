 *  So first up I will need a world in which i can portrait everything duh
 *  in that world to properly display everything i will need a start-point, a point of origin, a viewpoint, A Camera
 *  so thats the first thing i will have to make -> Kamera
 *  then to test if the camera works i will need something to display, for that i will have the differen typse of Objects -> Koerper
 *  on one hand something simple but works to test most things, a line from one point to another
 *  on the other something more advanced to actually do what i wanted to, a cube with alle 8 corners and 6 sides working on displaying what when
